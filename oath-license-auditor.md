# Quality Assurance Engineer “Build Auditor”
**A bit about us:**

Oath’s Open Source Program Office supports the successful use of Open Source projects across all mobile engineering teams at Oath. Oath published nearly 200 mobile apps and dozens of mobile SDKs for our products and partners. Open Source is part of most everything we do. 
* We’re looking for someone to be part of our team to help support our mission.
* We help ensure our apps and SDKs comply with Open Source licensing terms.
* We work with our mobile excellence team, our paranoids, and legal teams to track and approve product launches.

We work openly across the industry, through our participation in organizations such as the TodoGroup, Apache Software Foundation, Linux Foundation, and others, sharing the story of Oath’s Open Source evolution, at internal events, external conferences, and other venues.

**A lot about you:**

You love to build mobile apps. Organizing gradle files and cocoapods comes naturally to you. You want to be part of the process that puts mobile apps on phones, apps that deliver the mail, sports scores, news, weather, AR experiences, shopping, and just about anything else people do on their phone. You are comfortable working in a collaborative and sometimes chaotic environment. You work well with people, and you work well independently. You get the job done and solve problems using automation. You aspire to grow a career based on Open Source and getting visibility for the work you do. You are familiar with Open Source licenses.

**Responsibilities:**
* Operate a license scanning tool and review Open Source license compliance.
* Track compliance issues and help fix them before they apps are shipped.
* Integrate auditing into CI/CD processes.
* Work with a vendor on tool integration issues, representing our needs to them, and helping us take full advantage of the vendor’s capabilities and services.
* Helping prepare Open Source attribution documentation
* Work with our security team to ensure we leverage their security processes.

**Preferred Qualifications:**
* At least 2 years of mobile app and SDK development experience, with a working knowledge of and a passion for Java, Objective C, and Swift.
* You are familiar with CI/CD principles.
* You are fluent with Git and familiar with GitHub.
* You can speak and write clearly with both technical and non-technical audiences.

Ideally, we see this role being based in Sunnyvale, CA about 90% of the time with a few days per month spent in San Francisco. We call this role the Build Auditor, since you’d be auditing the build and making sure that we don’t ship anything you didn’t review. We’re going to start you off with a mobile app and SDK focus, but we have plans beyond that. If this sounds like something you like to do, let’s talk about how Oath’s Open Source Program Office can help take your career to the next level!
