**Now, About You**

You are an experienced open source software developer with a passion for engineering. You have hands-on experience with Node.JS, Javascript, Python, web development, and other scripting languages, you probably code in Java too. You understand how Github works and have an aptitude to learn new skills. You believe code must be high quality code. You are curious and willing to learn new skills.

You are comfortable working in a collaborative and sometimes chaotic environment. You work well with people, and you work well independently. You are a consummate professional, but barriers don’t stop you. You get the job done. You are open to ideas, and embrace diversity of perspective to help refine your ideas. You solve problems using automation. You aspire to grow a career based on open source and get visibility for the work you do.

A typical day may have you work on one of of the following:
