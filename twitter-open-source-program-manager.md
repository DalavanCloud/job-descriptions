## Position: Open Source Program Manager

### Who We Are
Open-source is vital to Twitter. We rely on many amazing projects from the community to run our business and regularly share with the world what we build internally. In fact, all of our technology stacks have been almost fully open-sourced. Mesos, Finagle, Scalding, Heron, and Pants are just some of the projects we’ve released over the years, and have been thrilled by the engagement and collaboration we’ve enjoyed with the open-source community.

Our open source efforts are currently lead by a small multi-functional group of engineers and we are looking for a motivated, visionary individual to take Twitter Open Source to the next level.

### What You’ll Do:
* You’ll work with our Engineering, Legal, Security, Comms, and Recruiting teams to craft the direction for open-source at Twitter that is both empowering and lasting.
* You’ll ensure we intake and release open source software via a mature process that builds healthy communities, unblocks engineers, aligns with our business goals, protects our intellectual property, and manages our compliance.
* You’ll guide and up-level our engineering teams on their OSS initiatives.
* You’ll own our open-source presence and reputation, and represent Twitter Engineering with open-source organizations, standards bodies, on GitHub, and beyond.
* You’ll directly impact the culture of open-source at Twitter

### Who You Are:
* You have the passion for open-source, you get why it exists, why it works, and where it makes the most sense.
* You dig creating sustainable communities that continue to exist long after you are gone.
* You are pragmatic, iterative, and customer-driven. You focus on where you can add the most value and automate/delegate the rest.
* You are organized, self-starter, and resourceful. You know how and when to ask for help.
* You are an excellent communicator, both up/down the management chain and externally.

### You Will Have Experience With:
* Building and growing developer communities.
* Organizing, promoting, and running large developer-focused events.
* Open-source licenses and general open-source compliance issues.
* Technical competence with multiple programming languages/environments, such as Python, JavaScript, Java, Scala, or Go.
* Open source dependency management tools.
* GitHub and open-source CI tooling (e.g. Travis CI, Coveralls, CircleCI).
* Managing sustainable organizational programs with many distributed stakeholders.
