**Now, About You**

You are very familiar with the open source industry. You are skilled with the art of managing complicated projects with many moving parts. You are great at keeping a team focused on the highest priority issues. You are technical enough to understand what our projects do and help those who seek to learn them. You are a consummate professional and barriers don’t stop you. You are open to ideas, and embrace diversity of perspective to help refine your ideas. You put the customer first.

A typical day may have you work on one of of the following:
