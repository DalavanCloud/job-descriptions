If so, Microsoft’s Open Source Programs Office is looking for an engineer like you.

## Who We Are

We’re a small, agile team responsible for enabling open source culture change across all of Microsoft’s engineering organizations: 

* We are responsible for designing, developing and deploying the tools that engineers use to manage open source repos, CLAs, licenses, third-party disclosures, and source code.

* We tell the story of Microsoft’s open source evolution, at internal events, external conferences, partner briefings, and many other venues.

As a Senior Developer on the team, you’ll quickly learn that this isn’t a typical Microsoft developer role. This is a role where you’ll use tools like Node.js, TypeScript and JavaScript to find creative solutions to engineering challenges. You’ll meet and work closely with engineering leaders from across Microsoft, as well as your counterparts in other major tech companies that are also embracing open source on a massive scale. You’ll feel the excitement of working in a data-driven startup culture combined with the satisfaction of having a broad impact across a huge number of engineers and projects. You will enjoy a front-row seat on high-visibility internal projects to help Microsoft transform and be even more open. 

## Who You Are
First and foremost, you’re an experienced open source software developer with a passion for engineering systems. You have hands-on experience in web development, and you understand the principles behind cloud computing. Your core technical skills include:
* 3-5 years of web development experience, with a working knowledge of and a passion for Node, TypeScript or JavaScript
* Fluency in using Git and GitHub, and experience in contributing to open source projects
* Understanding of metrics-driven data analysis to software design and planning
* Whether you call it full-stack development or polyglot programming, the ability to pick the best tool for the job and integrate an array of technologies into a reliable high-performance solution.
* Experience with cloud services and/or running services in production

In addition to your technical skills, you’re comfortable working in an environment where you need to adapt to dynamic changes in requirements. You understand how to employ scrum and agile techniques to stay focused and productive in the face of change. You thrive at cross-team collaboration, enjoy openness and diversity and use great communication and presentation skills to convey your message.
