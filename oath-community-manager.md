# Sr. Technical Community Manager

**A bit about us:**

Oath’s Open Source Program Office supports the growth and adoption of important open source projects at Oath. We’re looking for someone to be part of our team to support our mission to grow adoption of our projects.
* We publish important open source projects in the areas of Big Data, AI, and cloud computing.
* We contribute to important open source projects in the industry. We partner with tech companies and open source communities to improve the state of internet technology.
* We collaborate closely with engineering teams, marketing, legal and PR, and we work openly across the industry through our participation in organizations such as the TodoGroup, Apache Software Foundation, Linux Foundation and others, sharing the story of Oath’s open source evolution, at internal events, external conferences, and other venues.

**A lot about you:**

You are familiar with the open source industry and have managed open source projects. You are comfortable speaking on stage representing our projects, and you are skilled with the art of behind the scenes community management. You are comfortable with traveling and developing connections with people in different industries who seek to interact with our open source projects. You are technical enough to understand what our projects do and help those who seek to learn them. You are a consummate professional; barriers don’t stop you. You are open to ideas, and embrace diversity of perspective to help refine your ideas. You put the customer first.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identify industry partners interested in learning about our open source projects.
* Speak at meetups and conferences on behalf of Oath’s Open Source Program Office
* Organize and participate in events such as meetups, hackathons, and business development opportunities with potential partners.
* Support partners in their use of our open source projects.
* Be a service to engineering teams to help their projects get traction.
* Help write examples and documentation for our open source projects.

**Preferred Qualifications:**

* At least 10 years of working experience in the open source industry.
* You are fluent using GitHub.
* You are a very capable public speaker.
* You can author compelling blog posts and impressive presentations.

This role is largely based in Silicon Valley, but you'll need to travel too. You might find yourself spending a week in Europe meeting with an engineering team followed by a week in the Far East working with a partner in open source. You'll be speaking at conferences discussing our big data solutions, our anomaly detection technologies, or the latest in our open source security tools. We expect 25-50% travel for this role.

You'd be a diplomat connecting us with open source communities. Your primary role will be to help a few engineering teams build their communities. You’ll also help with training, recruiting, and even blogging about our work. If that sounds like something you like to do, let’s talk about how Oath’s Open Source Program Office can help take your career to the next level!
